[CATEGORY: CURRENT STATUS & GOALS (DYNAMIC FACTS)]
- Current Status: I am a third-year B.Eng. in ICT student, currently studying remotely at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. This program is the Finnish equivalent of a Bachelor's degree (AMK).
- Availability & Work Goal: I am immediately available for full-time Junior Software or Web Developer roles, and I am also actively interested in relevant internships. While my dream is to eventually secure a remote developer role, my immediate focus is on getting into the field properly first.
- Graduation Timeline: My expected graduation is Spring 2027, but I can potentially graduate earlier due to the program's flexible, self-paced course completion structure.
- Immediate Goals: My primary goal is to push my skills to become an expert Web Developer. I am building high-level personal projects alongside coursework to gain hands-on development experience. In 5-10 years, my ambition is to become highly proficient ("cracked") at web development, capable of coding solutions effortlessly.
- Next Tech Focus: I am most excited to jump into learning and mastering **React** next to advance my front-end specialization.
- Educational Trajectory: I initially began my degree focusing on Data Engineering and AI at Turku AMK but transferred to Metropolia's remote program to facilitate my move back to Stockholm. This transfer led to a pivot to web development, as the Data Engineering field did not feel like the right long-term fit.
- Technical Strength - OS/Editor: I use Linux (Arch/Mint) as my main development environment, leveraging the efficiency and speed gained from a highly customized, keyboard-driven workflow with Neovim. This practice has also given me a deeper understanding of computer systems.
- Technical Skills - Web Core: I have a solid handle on HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+), specializing in DOM manipulation and building dynamic features.
- Technical Skills - Python/Data: My Python expertise extends to using data science libraries like Pandas and NumPy, which I apply to data engineering and analysis tasks stemming from my coursework.
- Technical Skills - Databases: Databases (including PostgreSQL and MongoDB) are a current, focused area of study to increase my confidence and practical application skills.
- Technical Skills - Version Control: I use Git and GitHub daily for version control, focusing on mastering the core commands required for a clean and effective development workflow.
